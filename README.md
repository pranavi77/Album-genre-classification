# EfficientNet Image Classification

EfficientNet-based image classification implemented as part of a CS 7643 Deep Learning course project.

## Overview
This repository contains the EfficientNet model implementation, training pipeline, and configuration used for Album genre classification experiments.

## My Contribution
- Implemented EfficientNet model
- Built training and evaluation pipeline
- Managed configuration via YAML
- Trained and evaluated model

## Files
- efficientnet.py: EfficientNet model definition
- dataloader.py: Dataset loading and preprocessing
- train_efficientnet.py: Training script
- config_efficientnet.yaml: Training configuration

## Setup
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Run
python train_efficientnet.py

## Report
The full project report is available in `docs/`.
This was a team project for CS 7643 (Deep Learning).
My primary contribution was the EfficientNet architecture, training pipeline,
hyperparameter tuning, and analysis (Section 3.1.2).
